# 📚 Optimization
Welcome to my Optimization repository. This repository includes my MSc thesis from UBC Sauder School of Business and the corresponding Python implementation of the hybrid optimization model developed in my research. Additionally, it includes two published papers from my MSc research at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), focusing on the supply and allocation of scarce healthcare resources.

🔗  **Online Retail Inventory Optimization**

📄 **Amazon Inventory Management** → [View PDF](https://baharaghababaei.github.io/Optimization/Amazon_Inventory_management_optimization.pdf)  
Detailed MSc thesis document including theoretical explanations, methodology, and numerical results. This research was implemented on UBC's ARC Sockeye high-performance computing cluster.

🐍 **Python Implementation (Jupyter Notebook)** → [View Notebook](https://github.com/baharaghababaei/Optimization/blob/main/docs/code/Algorithm.ipynb)  
Python notebook demonstrating the workflow of the developed optimization algorithm. (Note: The original dataset is large; therefore, a smaller, representative dataset was used for this implementation.)

🔗 **Healthcare Scarce Resources Optimization**

🏥 **Two-Stage Optimization model for Scarce Drug Supply** → [View Paper](https://baharaghababaei.github.io/Optimization/two_stage_optimization_model.pdf)   
This research introduces a two-stage fuzzy optimization model for allocating scarce pharmaceutical resources under uncertainty. It incorporates rolling horizon planning and an iterative procedure to maximize suppliers' profit and minimize the shortage.

💊 **Bi-Level Programming Model for Drug Rationing** → [View Paper](https://baharaghababaei.github.io/Optimization/bi-level_programming_model.pdf)   
A bi-level programming approach that models the interaction between government policies and healthcare suppliers. This research integrates game theory concepts (Stackelberg competition and Nash equilibrium) to optimize drug pricing and allocation during critical shortages.
